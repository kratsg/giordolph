🎵Giordon, the red-nosed FOSS dev
he works on the LHC
he rides on lots of airplanes
and he has his PhD

All of the other FOSS devs
Saw his profile pic in place
And if they saw another
Couldn’t recognize his face

Then on gitlab.cern.ch
Giordon’s profile pic
Did not have the red nose key
Folks said “who the hell is he?”

Giordon, the red-nosed FOSS dev
Had to change his picture back
This was commemorated
By some words Mel wrote in Slack 🎵
